title: What is this notes thing?

My main blog is for well-researched topics, and I try to be generally neutral with my takes, though obviously everyone has some or the other bias. Not all of the posts over on my main blog are completely neutral, [the OSes one](/tech/operating-systems) is full of my opinions, for instance. However, I still wanted a place away from all that, just to post my own thoughts. So I guess that's what this is: a place for me to just write about whatever's on my mind, without the pressure of having to find sources and research everything first.

Don't get me wrong, I'll still keep writing blog posts (eventually, I've got a lot of stuff going on right now), and I love doing the research that I do into random topics that I find myself interested in. But sometimes I just wanna let loose and say what's on my mind or post my opinion on a topic that's maybe not necessarily backed up by any science or research. Consider it my own microblog, I suppose.

I've got at least 2 things I want to write about here, so I'll do that soon (hopefully). Seeya next time!
